**Version 1.7.5**
**New Features:**
- Force crop and aspect ratio modes for 4:3 videos on 16:9 displays
- Multiscreen reliability improvements

**Coming soon:**
- ability to scale video as well as crop ✓
- Works with any HTML5 player (Including iFrame & WebM) ✓
- Firefox support
- Better Icon ✓
- Support for Flash Player content possible? Maybe override Flash's native fullscreen method?

*Flash support is probably unneeded, due to most Flash-based players having scaling settings in the context menu.*
